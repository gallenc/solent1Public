## Exercises

    Write an app which centres on your home town and adds a marker at the centre of your home town. Use informationfreeway.org to find the longitude and latitude of your home town.
    Find points of interest in your home town (such as pubs, churches, restaurants, sports grounds, etc) in your home town, and add markers to each. Make an appropriate Toast message appear when the user taps on the marker, as in the example above.

    is a CSV file containing the location of local points of interest (format: name,type,description,lon,lat). Save this on your device; save to your U: drive first and then upload to the device using DDMS (upload to the /storage/sdcard folder on the device).

    Modify the app so that it loads this file on startup, interprets each line of the CSV file (see file I/O for how to interpret CSV files), and displays each restaurant in the file as a marker. Again, make an appropriate Toast message appear when the user taps on the marker.
    Advanced exercise: use different markers for different point of interest types. There are some sample markers here.
