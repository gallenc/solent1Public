## Mobile Application Development - Topic 3 Maps

# #Exercise 1
http://www.free-map.org.uk/course//mad/part3.php
Try the example above out. It should show a map of Fernhurst, West Sussex (about 30 miles/50km east of here).
Use the site informationfreeway.org to look up the latitude and longitude of your home town. Make the map centre on your home town instead.
Publish your work on GitHub. See the Git Cheat Sheet for guidance. We will go through this in class.
#Exercise 2 - Consolidation
This exercise allows you to revise the previous layouts and event handling topic. Enhance your app so that it has a UI like this. Create the XML by hand; do not use the UI designer.
