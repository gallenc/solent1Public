Solent Stores - Shopping cart exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to extend/improve/finish the solent stores exercise from last week. Once this is done, please work on your assignment.
Add real time form validation

The quantity box should go red if a number is entered below 0 or above 100.
Add an order summary

Above the checkout button add a order summary. This should be a list of items that have been selected in human readable form. It should be updated in real-time. To achieve this you'll need to add a desc attribute to each of you of your check boxes:

```<input type="checkbox" name="product" data-desc="Milk Tray" value="mt">```

Save the order in a firebase database
